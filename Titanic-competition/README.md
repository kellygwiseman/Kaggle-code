Titanic-competition
===================

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this Kaggle challenge, we are asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

I used the python package scikit-learn to perform all of the data modeling.  I used several machine learning tools, including the following classifiers: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, adaboost, and gradient boosting. Since this is a knowledge competition, I wanted to both learn how to use a variety of classifiers, and to see how well they perform on the Titanic dataset. 

This Ipython notebook contains all of the code I used for this Kaggle competition.
